# Capstone--Social-Media-tourism
Instead of reaching out to each customer, an aviation company wants to take a more focused approach. 
With the help of data science, they want to understand the customer's social media behavior and patterns 
towards buying a travel package. To do so, they collaborated with social media platforms to procure the 
data. 
With this attempt we will evaluate the online and social activity of the target audience in order to deliver 
digital advertisements to users who are most likely to purchase the tourism package.
We analyzed the data systematically by performing various steps like EDA, Data cleaning and 
Preprocessing, Model building and finally giving our insights and recommendations on our findings.
